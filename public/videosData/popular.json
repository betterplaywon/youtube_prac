        "description": "Watch the Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2 gameplay trailer and then play Fortnite Battle Royale now - https://www.fortnite.com/chapter-4-season-2\n\nNew city, new streets. Be a flash of light with the sleek, aerodynamic “Victory Crown Rogue” (a.k.a. “Rogue Bike”). This two-person sports bike features high acceleration, sharp turning, and a boost-ready engine. Prefer a four-wheel ride? Get in the “Nitro Drifter” and use its handbrake to drift ‘round the bend.\n\nCome out swinging when you’re done swerving: acquire a “Kinetic Blade” and perform the artful “Knockback Slash.” Not holding back? Show no mercy and perform the devastating “Dash Attack.”\n\nThe streets aren’t the only way to get about MEGA City. Jump on its grind rails then skate around the buildings and your enemies. Even use your weapons as you ride!\n\nNeed a break from urban battle? Step foot on the fresh, teal-tinted grass of MEGA City’s surroundings. This city isn’t the only new location in Chapter 4 Season 2 — it’s just one part of a brand new biome! See the cherry blossoms of “Steamy Springs,” fish in the waters of “Knotty Nets,” hone your skills at “Kenjutsu Crossing,” and more.\n\nLook mega good with Chapter 4 Season 2’s Battle Pass Outfits. With the Chapter 4 Season 2 Battle Pass purchase, you’ll auto-unlock the fine-tailored “Renzo the Destroyer.” Progress through the Battle Pass to unlock other Outfits, including the streetwear savant “Thunder,” the elegantly casual “Highwire,” and more.  \n\nLater in the Season, unlock another Outfit in the Battle Pass: anime protagonist “Eren Jaeger”!\n\n#Fortnite #FortniteGameplayTrailer #FortniteMEGA",

          "description": "Watch the Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2 gameplay trailer and then play Fortnite Battle Royale now - https://www.fortnite.com/chapter-4-season-2\n\nNew city, new streets. Be a flash of light with the sleek, aerodynamic “Victory Crown Rogue” (a.k.a. “Rogue Bike”). This two-person sports bike features high acceleration, sharp turning, and a boost-ready engine. Prefer a four-wheel ride? Get in the “Nitro Drifter” and use its handbrake to drift ‘round the bend.\n\nCome out swinging when you’re done swerving: acquire a “Kinetic Blade” and perform the artful “Knockback Slash.” Not holding back? Show no mercy and perform the devastating “Dash Attack.”\n\nThe streets aren’t the only way to get about MEGA City. Jump on its grind rails then skate around the buildings and your enemies. Even use your weapons as you ride!\n\nNeed a break from urban battle? Step foot on the fresh, teal-tinted grass of MEGA City’s surroundings. This city isn’t the only new location in Chapter 4 Season 2 — it’s just one part of a brand new biome! See the cherry blossoms of “Steamy Springs,” fish in the waters of “Knotty Nets,” hone your skills at “Kenjutsu Crossing,” and more.\n\nLook mega good with Chapter 4 Season 2’s Battle Pass Outfits. With the Chapter 4 Season 2 Battle Pass purchase, you’ll auto-unlock the fine-tailored “Renzo the Destroyer.” Progress through the Battle Pass to unlock other Outfits, including the streetwear savant “Thunder,” the elegantly casual “Highwire,” and more.  \n\nLater in the Season, unlock another Outfit in the Battle Pass: anime protagonist “Eren Jaeger”!\n\n#Fortnite #FortniteGameplayTrailer #FortniteMEGA"
